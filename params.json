Don't try to back a big website with it yet.  Nonetheless, it works,\r\nand it passes all its tests on Heroku as well.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    repository = RDF::DataObjects::Repository.new \"sqlite3:test.db\"\r\n    repository.insert(statement)\r\n    repository.count              #=> 1\r\n    repository.delete(statement)\r\n\r\nYou can use any DataObjects compatible connection options to create a new\r\nrepository, but only SQLite3 and Postgres are implemented for now.  The\r\ndifferent databases are *just* different enough with their handling of unique\r\nconstraints that some database-specific work is required for a new adapter, but\r\nit's not much.\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\n\r\nThe greatly preferred installation method is via RubyGems:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo gem install rdf-do\r\n\r\nManual downloads are available at <http://github.com/bhuga/rdf-do/downloads>\r\n\r\nRuby 1.8.6 is not supported, but the tests pass with the backports gem.  Godspeed.\r\n\r\n## Connecting:\r\n    require 'do_postgres'\r\n    require 'do_sqlite3'\r\n    repo = RDF::DataObjects::Repository.new \"postgres://localhost/database\"\r\n    repo = RDF::DataObjects::Repository.new \"sqlite3:test.db\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using:\r\n\r\nYour repository is a fully-functional RDF.rb `RDF::Repository`.  As with any\r\nRDF.rb repository, this includes the mixins `RDF::Enumerable`, `RDF::Mutable`,\r\n`RDF::Durable`, and `RDF::Queryable`.  Please see <http://rdf.rubyforge.org/RDF/Repository.html> for\r\nmore information.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    require 'rdf'\r\n    require 'rdf/ntriples'\r\n    require 'data_objects'\r\n    require 'do_sqlite3'\r\n    require 'rdf/do'\r\n\r\n    repo = RDF::DataObjects::Repository.new('sqlite3:test.db')\r\n    # repo = RDF::DataObjects::Repository.new 'postgres://postgres@server/database'\r\n    # heroku_repo = RDF::DataObjects::Repository.new(ENV['DATABASE_URL'])\r\n    repo.load('http://datagraph.org/jhacker/foaf.nt')\r\n\r\n    # How many statements did we have?\r\n    repo.count\r\n    #=> 10\r\n\r\n    # Get the URI of the first subject\r\n    jhacker = repo.first.subject\r\n    #=> #<RDF::URI(http://datagraph.org/jhacker/foaf)>\r\n\r\n    # Delete everything to do with it\r\n    jhacker_statements = repo.query(:subject => jhacker) \r\n    repo.delete *jhacker_statements\r\n    repo.count\r\n    #=> 7\r\n\r\n    # with Postgres, we could have done this, but SQLite gives us a locking error:\r\n    # repo.delete(*repo.query(:subject => jhacker))\r\n\r\n    # Changed our mind--bring it back\r\n    repo.insert *jhacker_statements\r\n    repo.count\r\n    #=> 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Developing\r\n\r\nThe main project page is on Github, at <http://github.com/bhuga/rdf-do>.  You\r\ncan get a working copy of the source tree with:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/bhuga/rdf-do.git\r\n\r\nOr with:\r\n\r\n    $ wget http://github.com/bhuga/rdf-do/tarball/master\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nThe preferred method to report issues is the issue queue at\r\n<http://github.com/bhuga/rdf-do/issues>.  You'll get the the most attention if\r\nyou submit a failing test for a bug, or a pending test for a feature. \r\n\r\nWe'd also like to hear from you on the mailing list:\r\n<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby>\r\n\r\n### Miscellany\r\n\r\n * Author: Ben Lavender | <blavender@gmail.com> | <http://bhuga.net> | <http://blog.datagraph.org>\r\n * 'License':  RDF::DataObjects is free and unemcumbered software released into the public domain.
